# Loan_Approval_Prediction
&lt;h5>In this project, we will predict if according to certain information of a person, will he/she be accepted by the bank for a loan or not. As there will be categorical values, we will have to use models which can fit categorical values

We will process the data, deal with missing values in multiple ways, visualize the data and model our data according to certain requirements.

Multiple models were trained and the model with the best accuracy was choosen to predict our results which were then stored.
